# AZIE Starships
A mod that adds Elite-like starships and gameplay mechanics, as well as fantasy-ish things like space whales, dragons, worms (like in Calamity mod) and other not-so-scifi things (kinda like Zelda TotK).
Has its own lore and questline.
Is probably compatible with some QoL mods like waila, nei and others, but not designed to go too well with other major mods like mekanism.
